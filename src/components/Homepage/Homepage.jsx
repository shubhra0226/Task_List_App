        At their most basic, to-dos contain all of the tasks that you need to complete on a given
        day. Itâ€™s a great device for managing time that enables you to lay out everything that you
        need to accomplish and plan and prioritize your day from there. You can also make to-dos
        for major tasks like a work assignment or an overall goal. Therefore, the overall purpose
        of creating a to-do is to remember tasks and create a plan of action to accomplish them.
